#Project 3: Noise localization using SVM classification/regression
The inspiration and theory for this project can be found in chapter 4 of the thesis.
By using spectral estimates as features, the Angle of Arrival (AoA) of a noise signal can be determined using Support Vector Machines (SVM) classificiation.
